``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;but when past joking he fell sick,he really forced one to admire him --and never played a shrewder trick.Let others learn from his example!But God, how deadly dull to samplesickroom attendance night and dayand never stir a foot away!And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,of entertaining the half-dead:one smoothes the pillows down in bed,and glumly serves the medicine bottle,and sighs, and asks oneself all through:"When will the devil come for you?"''---------------------------------------------
