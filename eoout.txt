Who’s got his wit to be quite calm,A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:A lady’s love until to-day To speak her Russian isn’t trying,A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flowsA lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...A menu hangs for order’s sake And teases appetite in vain.A mere hit from all I’d give.A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fieldsA mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.A need for sleep.A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.A passionate epistle’s writing.A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;A shepherd bast gay sandal’s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.A simple maidenA smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.A yard boy’s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sitA young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: ‘Well, he’s killed...’About Lensky’s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wroteAbout girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relation’s lint, -About news and fashions dear With dolls she didn’t talk at all,About other’s restless passions, And other’s love will touch the heart, -About what she’s now dreaming?Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,Across a glade, all under snow Around which all’s dark and sad.Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,Across the torrent have been laid.

Katenin there could restoreShe sees: the room is light again, Through window’s a frosty paneAh, he could love; they don’t now Have anything like real loveBut such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old apeWith hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentlePerhaps I’ll grieve if in a whileHe so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite freeIn winter, when the night’s weak shadeTo Petushkóv she never goes; Pykhtín, the hussar, toed to fuseBy nothing bound, I’m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for meAgainst Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more paleYou’ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hopeI dread: in my submissive prayers You’ll see by strict, severe gazeGod knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious codeAnd I’ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful loveAll things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry tasteBut none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chanceThe secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endureThe talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every sideHe’ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verseAt Kharitónya’s in the alley In front of house at the gateAnd far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adoreI could defineBetween affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasureOn leave the gussars hasten hereThey now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in lineAway from Eugene’s lips; morose, He’s awkward, hardly has he forceAll lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would likeTo judgings by the world severeOne vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dareUnbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a lineSometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enableIn it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, heHe’s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education can’t adhereAnd he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; that’s why at borneIt’s true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me‘In all the world its most badly To see in family the wifeAs now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pieA forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fineFor mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriageRevealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of peopleTo twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure oneHis life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his homeI now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor styleAh, don’t mind’ -My friend, by God to hail I dare —- D’you joke -The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what d’you think? again collapse!’Will show my renowned face And say: ‘It’s poet of grace!’You lie, young hard, in peace all age!’To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!’They rush into the yard at once!Enough, my friend, its all the same!Its nicer, friends, much more when he Is wailing foolishly: its me!And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!She’s mere infant, But yet coquette!

To whom he privately, in haze,His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,Yet being child, in children’s throng To play and jump had none desire,The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,I live and write not for applause,With Tanya Lensky; Kharlikóva, The bride of more than ripening age,In brackets I would like to note: You haven’t more insulting lie,Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,With war; with magazine’s white lie; With snow and with own wife,Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,He looks al her with tender ardour; He’s yet beloved with previous force,Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,The love’s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,‘Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,‘If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,If you could know, what’s diminished To languish in the thirst for love,He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate,Tatyana to the yard, such wide,Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,While he prefered to play a steed. His finger’s frozen a little,But his such sufferable shade,And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate,But well, she’s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sister’s pretty grace,Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,And great belief in world’s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,It’s right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,The heart of somebody he’ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,Alas, Tatyana’s daily fading: She’s paling, sinking and is mute,He doesn’t gather them with horn. A maiden’s singing in her house,Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maiden’s names by names from France,To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,In vain I try to be aware,But soon for husband, all at once,But Tanya’s heart yet isn’t gladdened, To meet the winter never came,It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,He couldn’t be a bard for ever, He didn’t go mad or die,Tatyana’s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,Sometimes with own blood she wrote To lady’s album if by chance,The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,And with Onegin’s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,And much the more it’s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,That time, when in lyceum’s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw one’s gaze,But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,You must remember that day time,I’d like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe,The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,To such an album, being tight, If to confess, I’d like to write,With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,Such men (I’m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maiden’s choice,She’s running - he is after her; She can’t be running any more,‘But who is she?’ She is my wife,Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.You poets, are queer!’ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.Or roses of flaming cheeks, Or bosom, which awaits for fortune.My poor Lensky! badly pining Not very long was weeping she.By winter carpets, snow-made.But road alarm of love then filled me.The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.Italian nights I shall adore.She’s after me.Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didla’s crowned there.He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.Which’s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soul’s haze.My Lensky’s feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance.It’s mute for ever all at once.A mere hit from all I’d give.And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.Have less in difference between Each one.But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.But well, its time I should be busy: The beauty’s letter I should use.In tender manner they agree.From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.Upstairs to the highest rate.Alas! for funs, which can be differed, I’ve ruined much of own life.The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.For long is weeping she this time.They friends became.And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.For husband then she was yet bride.And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.To have a rest and have a hike, That’s why I’ll finish other time.Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.Arid, following Petrarka’s tracks, Could calm his heart’s the biggest trouble.The morning pleasant noise arose.Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.The fisher’s fire.Was talking much of them with pride.The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.Expresses death but not the torture.He can’t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.Replace the fortune.In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student he’s a dunce.With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy brow’s languid peace.By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letter’s trembling on her palm, The wafer’s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.Malfilatre.In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time.From novel’s only beginning — I’ve finished now chapter one.‘I’ll perish, - says my Tanya’s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.Some real honour and the pride.Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.All’s blight, all’s white without shade.It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.In life with us like new it’s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.All services of old time.I can’t foresee any objection To this representation made.As pawn that’s worth of dear mate.Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came.Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.Pm sure... none, They’ll be the family, the one.To play the cards was used with me.Of girls, the tears, faints not rare: Enough he had them all en route.Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.Fille était fille, elle était amourese. She was a girl She was in love.Marmontel’s volume them he gave.In wonder style To every place he came in time.The boy was frisky but with grace.Of course, of him I’ll quickly know,- For him I now haven’t time.Is drawn, in turn I’ve bad nay time.Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.And unattentive smart lornette.It is forgivable.I don’t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.La, sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi, 			Nasce una gente a cui i’morir non dole.Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness She’d catch one’s eyes by simple face.It’s late.Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldn’t be.With time I’d smooth and then might be I’d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.He’s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.«Freischutz» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume.When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.Who’s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.But then a frenchman took her place.The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.The capital’s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.Boom could fade.There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.I have without any doubts Tatyana’s letter to translate.Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.His epigram’s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.At Verrey’s every morning’s time On credit drank three quarts of wine.Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.The shepherd’s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.The colonel sent it for the chance.He’s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! He’s blessed, who well in time was ripe.Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.I don’t mean to please grand people.Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.And even this my chapter five — From all digressions to refine.At Simeon’s he’s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.Of young delirium high rage.Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, she’s free.Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.But I… it doesn’t bother me: To old times I’ll loyal be.To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.In man’s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have you’d like, Or Eden to itself’s unlike.Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race.They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.I write it, as for long my time I haven’t any sin of mine.He’s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altar’s gone.I can’t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her it’s all the same.Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.Tatyana’s flushing, all she’s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.‘You, nanny, let me stay forlone.At such a year, such an age.By new one can’t I be admired I pity old one - it’s true.The foes put the capes on steppe.Or otherwise I’d be with rages By all my kin pursued for love.-‘You tell of those Your old times...

Some other, more severe issuesBlue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goesHe, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of gamesI keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when wavesBut in gloomy cliffsIn them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadaysSome wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of wordsAt rocks of the Caucasian districtsTriumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer tormentsAlas! On furrows of livesHis pistol then Onegin raisesThe lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocksWe’ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessionsWho listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflectionsSeverity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidingsBut then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelingsAnd she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lotsAt her much frightened loud criesSome big and shaggy bear comes ..

It’s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goesAnd like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and grovesTatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guessFor fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopesIn young sad soul’s aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passionsImmense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guessBut can’t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hades’ spectresHe was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remainsIndeed, by magnetism’s all forces The mechanism of Russian versesFrom saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trottersBut people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: What’s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon callsSome tears shed at urn my early: ‘He tell in love with me,’ to thinksIndeed, he’s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreamsLet give the God his soul chancesHis style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimesBut as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comesYou never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some printsOf ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But it’s a stressLike Byron, poet of grace. Or it’s impossible or faithlessBut where are you? Come!

And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,‘I weep...
