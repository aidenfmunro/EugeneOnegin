A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-      A broken voice, and his whole function suiting    A brother's murther!

A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?    A double blessing is a double grace;    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak    A face without a heart,'    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,    A little month, or ere those shoes were old    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be                                                 A noise within.                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;A room in the Castle.    A sable silver'd.    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,    A scullion!        A second time I kill my husband dead    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe    A station like the herald Mercury    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,               A table and flagons of wine on it.      A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom    A very noble youth. Mark.           A very, very- pajock.

Alack, and fie for shame!    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is         All flaxen was his poll.    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,    All given to mine ear.              All in the morning bedtime,    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

Treason! treason!  All. We will, we will!    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;    Among a mineral of metals base,      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'    An understanding simple and unschool'd;    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.            And I a maid at your window,    And I am sick at heart.    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.    And I beseech you instantly to visit    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose    And I do think- or else this brain of mine    And I the matter will reword; which madness    And I with them the third night kept the watch;    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,    And You must put me in your heart for friend,    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,      And after we will both our judgments join    And all we mourn for.      And am most sensibly in grief for it,      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,      And at the sound it shrunk in haste away    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes    And bear it to the chapel.    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,    And break your own neck down.    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-    And call it accident.    And call the noblest to the audience.    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,    And carriage of the article design'd,    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,    And could of men distinguish, her election    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,    And do not spread the compost on the weeds    And do such bitter business as the day    And do't the speedier that you may direct me    And draw you into madness? Think of it.    And drive his purpose on to these delights.    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed                And dupp'd the chamber door,    And each particular hair to stand an end    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,    And enterprises of great pith and moment    And even the like precurse of fierce events,    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!    And for his death no wind    And for my means, I'll husband them so well    And for my soul, what can it do to that,    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish    And for your rapier most especially,    And foreign mart for implements of war;    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh      And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,    And gave you such a masterly report    And gem of all the nation.    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.

And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,    And hears it roar beneath.    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,    And his commission to employ those soldiers,           And his sandal shoon.    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,    And hurt my brother.    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?    And in the cup an union shall he throw    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth    And in the porches of my ears did pour    And in this brainish apprehension kills    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,    And it must follow, as the night the day,    And keep you in the rear of your affection,      And lay your hands again upon my sword.    And leads the will to desperate undertakings    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see    And let him know so.    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,    And let them know both what we mean to do    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.    And let us once again assail your ears,    And live the purer with the other half,    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness    And makes each petty artire in this body    And makes us rather bear those ills we have    And many such-like as's of great charge,    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame      And more above, hath his solicitings,    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,    And my imaginations are as foul    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:      And never come mischance between us twain!      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall    And not have strew'd thy grave.    And not where I had aim'd them.    And nothing is at a like goodness still;    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself    And our affairs from England come too late.      And our vain blows malicious mockery.      And passion in the gods.'    And pious action we do sugar o'er      And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,    And prey on garbage.    And prologue to the omen coming on,    And put it in his pocket!      And reason panders will.    And recks not his own rede.    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.    And set a double varnish on the fame    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.    And so, without more circumstance at all,    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.    And sure I am two men there are not living    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,    And tell you what I know.    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands    And that I see, in passages of proof,    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality    And that in way of caution- I must tell you    And that our drift look through our bad performance.    And that shall lend a kind of easiness    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-      And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,    And there I see such black and grained spots    And there assume some other, horrible form    And there did seem in him a kind of joy    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd    And these few precepts in thy memory    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant      And they in France of the best rank and station    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.      And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,    And thus a while the fit will work on him.    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,    And thus the native hue of resolution    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!    And thy commandment all alone shall live    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse    And to the last bended their light on me.    And to the manner born, it is a custom    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge    And vanish'd from our sight.    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear    And we beseech you, bend you to remain           And we cast away moan.    And we did think it writ down in our duty    And we shall jointly labour with your soul    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,    And when you are desirous to be blest,    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon         And will he not come again?         And will he not come again?    And will not let belief take hold of him    And will not wrong it.    And will this brother's wager frankly play.    And with a larger tether may he walk    And with a look so piteous in purport    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd    And with no less nobility of love    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-    And, as I think, they have already order    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,    And, as the world were now but to begin,    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook    And, like a man to double business bound,      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;    And, sister, as the winds give benefit    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,    Anon, as patient as the female dove    Answer, and think upon this business.    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,    Appears before them and with solemn march      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid      Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies    Are joyfully return'd.    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,    Are most select and generous, chief in that.    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.      As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,    As England was his faithful tributary,    As I do thee. Something too much of this I    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,    As are companions noted and most known           'As by lot, God wot,'    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,    As checking at his voyage, and that he means    As day does to your eye.    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?    As did that one; and that, in my regard,    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed    As fits a king's remembrance.

As he in his particular act and place    As he is very potent with such spirits,    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder           As if I had never been such.    As if he had been loosed out of hell    As if increase of appetite had grown    As if it some impartment did desire    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,    As infinite as man may undergo-      As it behooves my daughter and your honour.    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk    As it doth well appear unto our state,    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found      As it is common for the younger sort    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.      As level as the cannon to his blank,    As love between them like the palm might flourish,      As low as to the fiends!    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,    As make your bouts more violent to that end-    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;    As meditation or the thoughts of love,    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?    As of a father; for let the world take note    As oft as any passion under heaven    As one incapable of her own distress,    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;    As therein are set down.    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,    As to expend your time with us awhile    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.    As to peace-parted souls.    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;    As will not leave their tinct.

Be something scanter of your maiden presence.    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.    Be you and I behind an arras then.    Be you content to lend your patience to us,    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.

Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple    Between the pass and fell incensed points         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?    Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,    Both to my God and to my gracious king;  Both. Arm'd, my lord.  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.    Both. Longer, longer.  Both. My lord, from head to foot.  Both. My lord, we will not.  Both. We will haste us.  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.  Both. We'll wait upon you.      Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,    Break we our watch up; and by my advice      Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,    But I do prophesy th' election lights      But I have that within which passeth show-    But I will delve one yard below their mines         But age with his stealing steps    But answer made it none. Yet once methought    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?    But better look'd into, he truly found    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!    But come!      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment    But do not go with it!    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice      But even then the morning cock crew loud,    But farewell it, for I will use no art.        But fill unshaken when they mellow be.    But from what cause he will by no means speak.    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw    But he's an arrant knave.    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,      But if the gods themselves did see her then,    But if you hold it fit, after the play    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,    But in battalions! First, her father slain;    But in our circumstance and course of thought,    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice    But keep a farm and carters.    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;    But let me hear from you.    But let that go.    But let this same be presently perform'd,    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;    But mere implorators of unholy suits,              But never doubt I love.    But never the offence.

But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.

How should I your true-love know    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself    How these things came about. So shall You hear    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now      How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;    I am afeard You make a wanton of me.    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my    I be so able as now.    I bought an unction of a mountebank,    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.      I cannot dream of. I entreat you both    I cannot live to hear the news from England,    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word    I could not but by her. The other motive    I dare damnation.

I do not know from what part of the world    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;    I do receive your offer'd love like love,    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!    I ha't!    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.    I had my father's signet in my purse,    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze    I have a voice and precedent of peace    I have in quick determination    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom    I have sworn't.    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe      I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,    I made to her in marriage, and to decline    I must be cruel, only to be kind;    I never gave you aught.    I once did hold it, as our statists do,    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.    I pray you go with me.    I pray you, now receive them.    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.    I shall not look upon his like again.    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.    I should have fatted all the region kites    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,    I stay too long. But here my father comes.    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.    I will bestow him, and will answer well    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my    I would know that.    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,      I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-    I'll rant as well as thou.    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,    I'll visit you.    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,    I, his sole son, do this same villain send    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,    If I had play'd the desk or table book,    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.    If by direct or by collateral hand    If circumstances lead me, I will find    If damned custom have not braz'd it so    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,    If his chief good and market of his time    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided    If it be made of penetrable stuff;    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do    If one could match you.

If thou art privy to thy country's fate,    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,    If with too credent ear you list his songs,    If you desire to know the certainty    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,    If you oppos'd them.

Two months since    Importing the surrender of those lands    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,    In censure of his seeming.    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,    In filial obligation for some term    In further evil?      In general synod take away her power;    In going back to school in Wittenberg,    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'

In obstinate condolement is a course    In the corrupted currents of this world    In the dead vast and middle of the night    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,    In thee there is not half an hour of life.    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?

Wilt thou know    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it    It had been so with us, had we been there.    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'      It is a damned ghost that we have seen,    It is a poison temper'd by himself.    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.    It is most retrograde to our desire;    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,    It lifted up it head and did address    It may be death.    It sends some precious instance of itself    It shall as level to your judgment pierce    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.    It warms the very sickness in my heart    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.    It waves you to a more removed ground.    It will be laid to us, whose providence    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,  King. A Norman.  King.

Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round  King. Gertrude, do not drink.  King. Give me some light! Away!  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,  King. Go seek him there.

What says Polonius?  King. He made confession of you;  King. How do you, pretty lady?  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?  King. How long hath she been thus?  King. How may we try it further?    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;  King. I do not think't.  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.  King. If it be so, Laertes  King. It falls right.  King. It likes us well;  King. It shall be so.  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.  King. Let him demand his fill.  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.    King. Let's further think of this,  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;    King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;  King. Not that I know.  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?  King. O Gertrude, come away!  King. O heavy deed!  King. O, for two special reasons,  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.  King. Our son shall win.  King. Part them! They are incens'd.  King.

So you shall;  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.  King. Thanks, dear my lord.  King. The doors are broke.  King. The very same.  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.  King.

King. What do you call the play?  King. What dost thou mean by this?    King. What is the cause, Laertes,  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.  King. Where is Polonius?  King. Who shall stay you?  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.  King. Why, now You speak  King. Will you know them then?  King.

I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed  Laer. I pray you give me leave.  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.

If this should fall,    May give his saying deed; which is no further    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?    May sweep to my revenge.    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:         Methought it was very sweet;    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.    More relative than this. The play's the thing    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him    More than in words?    Moreover that we much did long to see you,    Most free in his reply.    Most generous, and free from all contriving,    Most holy and religious fear it is    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust      Most necessary 'tis that we forget    Most throughly for my father.    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him    Must give us pause. There's the respect    Must render up myself.    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.    My custom always of the afternoon,    My father's brother, but no more like my father    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!    My father- methinks I see my father.    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to    My head should be struck off.    My liege, and madam, to expostulate    My lord, not I.    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.      My operant powers their functions leave to do.    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark    My soul is full of discord and dismay.      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile    My stern effects. Then what I have to do    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,    My tables! Meet it is I set it down    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,    My uncle?    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,    Nay, come, let's go together.  Near Elsinore.    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,              Never departed more.    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.    Never to speak of this that you have heard:    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:    Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day    No medicine in the world can do thee good.    No more to undertake it, I will work him    No more, sweet Hamlet!    No more.    No more; and by a sleep to say we end    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-    No reckoning made, but sent to my account    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,           No, no, he is dead;      No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,    No.      None wed the second but who killed the first.    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.    Nor customary suits of solemn black,    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd    Nor shall you do my ear that violence    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,    Not of that dye which their investments show,    Not shriving time allow'd.    Now I am alone.        Now falls on Priam.    Now fear I this will give it start again;    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.    Now wears his crown.      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;    Now, out of this-    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to    O good Horatio, what a wounded name    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever    O heat, dry up my brains!

O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,           O, a Pit of clay for to be made      O, ho!         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;    O, say!    O, speak!    O, step between her and her fighting soul    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs    O, vengeance!    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;    Of all their conference. If she find him not,    Of bell and burial.    Of blue Olympus.    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,    Of general assault.      Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,    Of him that brought them.    Of his affection to me.    Of his behaviour.    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,    Of his true state.    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;    Of man and country-    Of mighty opposites.    Of mine own eyes.      Of my true mother.      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.    Of the unworthiest siege.    Of these dilated articles allow.

Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,    There is a play to-night before the King.    There is no shuffling; there the action lies    There lives within the very flame of love    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;    There with fantastic garlands did she come    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,    There's such divinity doth hedge a king    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;    There, my lord.

To be contracted in one brow of woe,    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,                To be your Valentine.    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom    To both your honours.    To business with the King, more than the scope    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions    To cast thee up again. What may this mean         To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,      To desperation turn my trust and hope,    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever      To do't.

To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.    To give the world assurance of a man.    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.    To give these mourning duties to your father;    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage    To hear and see the matter.    To hear him so inclin'd.    To hear of it. They are here about the court,    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;    To heaven.

Therefore prepare you;    To let this canker of our nature come    To let you know of it.    To make it truster of your own report    To make oppression bitter, or ere this    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;      To mine own room again; making so bold      To muddy death.    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour    To offer it the show of violence;    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.    To outface me with leaping in her grave?    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.    To punish me with this, and this with me,    To put an antic disposition on),      To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd    To reason most absurd, whose common theme    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;    To show my duty in your coronation,      To show us so much gentry and good will    To show yourself your father's son in deed    To sing a requiem and such rest to her    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.    To take him in the purging of his soul,    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd    To tell my story.

With an attent ear, till I may deliver    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,    With an entreaty, herein further shown,    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,    With sore distraction.

Without debatement further, more or less,    Without more motive, into every brain    Without the sensible and true avouch    Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts;    Witness this army of such mass and charge,    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
